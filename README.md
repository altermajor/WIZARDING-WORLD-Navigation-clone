# WIZARDING-WORLD-Navigation-clone
My best attempt at recreating the navigation from the wizarding world website

# Project Details
I really liked the Navigation from the wizarding world website so I decided to recreate it. It's not perfect but at least it's fully responsive (try it!) :)

# Built with
Html
CSS & 
Vanilla JAVASCRIPT

# Issues
During this practice exercise I ran into multiple issues. The ones that took the most time to rectify were the hamburger menu animation and the styling of the dropdowns
